- Author's code repo: [https://github.com/williamleif/graphsage-simple](https://github.com/williamleif/graphsage-simple). Note that the original code is 
simple reference implementation of GraphSAGE.

In this code, we integrate cugraph with DGL, we use cugraph for sampling and DGL for training. 

Requirements
